# Auto-Brightness-Adjuster
Automatically adjust your brightness based on time of day and screen content. This script is pretty lightweight, with the .exe using around 1% of CPU and the .py using **next to no CPU**, around 0-0.1% and around **50 mb of memory**. Brightness will also get limited to 60% at night by default. To edit the brightness limits, press ctr+shift+b. You can also edit this hotkey in the same menu. If you want to customize it further, then you can edit the .py file and then run it or package it into a .exe with Pyinstaller.

## How to Use
To use, simply download and add the .exe or, preferably, the .py file (if you have Python installed) to startup apps.
